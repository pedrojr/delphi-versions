- Location, Motion and Orientation sensor components
- The following new conditionals are introduced/enabled: AUTOREFCOUNT, CPUARM, EXTERNAL_LINKER, IOS, NEXTGEN, UNDERSCOREIMPORTNAME, WEAKREF, WEAKINSTREF, WEAKINTREF
- New dependency directive for specifying the dependencies of an external library (undocumented until XE8)
