# Delphi 2007

- No language changes that I know of (Note that Delphi 2007 is a non-breaking release, DCU's from D2006 will work unchanged in D2007)
- The .NET 'personality' of 2007 introduced generics
- Introduced DBX4 as the next version of dbExpress
- VCL for Windows Vista
- IntraWeb / AJAX support
